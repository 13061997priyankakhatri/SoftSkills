Topic-2 ==> Impromptu Speech : IT POLICES

Answer:  

1> Acceptable Use Policy:

    -The Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) outlines the acceptable use of computer equipment. 

    -It is used for business purposes in serving the interests of the company, clients, and customers in the
     course of normal operations. 

    -The AUP defines inappropriate use of information systems and the risk that it may cause. 

    -Improper behavior may compromise the network system and may result in legal consequences. 

    -An example of inappropriate use is when an employee accesses data through a company computer for reasons
     other than doing his or her job. 

    -The AUP includes general use, appropriate behavior when handling proprietary or sensitive information,
     and unacceptable use.

2> Security Awareness And Training Policy :

    -Security awareness training is a strategy used by IT and security professionals to prevent and mitigate 
     user risk.  

    -These programs are designed to help users and employees understand the role they play in helping to 
     combat information security breaches. 

    -Effective security awareness training helps employees understand proper cyber hygiene, the security risks 
     associated with their actions and to identify cyber attacks they may encounter via email and the web.
   

3> Data Retention Policy:

    -A data retention policy, or a record retention policy, is a business’ established protocol for
     maintaining information. 

    -Typically, a data retention policy will define: 
    	1> What data needs to be retained
	2> The format in which it should be kept
	3> How long it should be stored for
	4> Whether it should eventually be archived or deleted
	5> Who has the authority to dispose of it
	6> What procedure to follow in the event of a policy violation

    -Though the primary purpose of a data retention policy is to ensure proper data management in accordance
     with relevant legal rules and regulations, it’s also an excellent way to enhance efficiency within your
     organization. 


4> Access Authorization, Modification, and Identity Access Management:
   
    -IAM is a set of processes, policies, and tools for controlling user access to critical information within 
     an organization.

    -It boosts security and provides greater control of user access to your system. 

    -This helps organizations mitigate data breaches, identity theft and illegal access to sensitive corporate 
     information.


5> Network Security Policy:

    -A network security policy is a formal document that outlines strategies for ensuring the confidentiality, 
     integrity, and availability of network-based data and resources.
    
    -Network security is important because it keeps sensitive data safe from cyber attacks and ensures the 
     network is usable and trustworthy. 

    -Successful network security strategies employ multiple security solutions to protect users and 
     organizations from malware and cyber attacks, like distributed denial of service.


6> Password Creation and Management Policy:

    -A password policy is a set of guidelines and rules that define how passwords should be created, used, and 
     protected in an organization’s network or web application.

    -Password policies help protect users from themselves by requiring them to create strong passwords and   
     change them regularly. 
    
    -This reduces the risk of their accounts being compromised due to weak passwords or password reuse.


7> Vendor Management Policy:

    -Vendor management policy is to identify which vendors put your organization at risk and then define 
     controls to minimize third-party and fourth-party risk. 

    -It starts with due diligence and assessing whether a third-party vendor should have access to sensitive 
     data.

    -Vendor risk management is important because managing vendor risk is foundational to cybersecurity, 
     ensuring business continuity and maintaining regulatory compliance. 

    -A robust vendor risk management (VRM) program can help organizations under their vendor risk profile and 
     mitigate third-party and fourth-party risk rather than relying on incident response.


8> Remote Access Policy:

    -A remote access policy is a policy that is developed by an organization to outline the rules and 
     regulations for employees to follow when they are accessing the network of an organization from an 
     external location. 

    -Remote access policies are important for protecting the assets of an organization from external threats.


9> Incident Response Policy:

    -Incident response (IR) is the process by which an organization handles a data breach or cyberattack. 

    -It is an effort to quickly identify an attack, minimize its effects, contain damage, and remediate the 
     cause to reduce the risk of future incidents.

10> Change Management Policy:

    -To a great extent, change management is the practice of facilitating the cultural changes necessary for    
     an organization to improve its business processes and meet the needs of a dynamic marketplace. 

    -By focusing on the impact of change, you can foresee problems and eliminate or reduce them before they 
     arise.
